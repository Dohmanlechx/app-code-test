# KRY code assignment
One of our developers built a simple weather reporting app. The app has a list of locations with waether information. Locations are fetched using a HTTP GET but the server is a bit flakey and fails sometimes. 

Unfortunately the app is not complete and its up to you to complete it. There is a wishlist for features to implement and some nice to have (bonus) features. 

Wish List (required):

- Implement the functionality to add a new location (post: https://app-code-test.kry.pet/locations, body: { id: "location_id",
name: "location_name", status: "status", temperature: 20}) 
- Implement the functionality to remove a location (delete: https://app-code-test.kry.pet/locations/:id)

Nice to haves (optional):

- Add nice animations
- Improvements to code
- Tests

Spend two to four hours working on this assignment - make sure to finish the issues you start.

Put the code in git repo on GitHub and send us the link (niklas.holmqvist@kry.se) when you're done. 

Good luck!
